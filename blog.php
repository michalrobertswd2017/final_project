        <h2 class=blog_title>Your child is an unidentified tree
        </h2>
    <p class="main_blog">
    Imagine that you have been handed a seed inside a blank packet. Surely you would be curious what it would turn out to be. And surely you would approach this seed with some wonder and curiosity. You may wonder where to plant it, how often to water it, how fast it will grow. You may have to wait years before you can tell what kind of fruit it bears, and before that fruit becomes viable.
CHANGE YOUR OUTLOOK AND YOUR INSIDE CHANGES.
Well, now it is time to pay some close attention.  Closer. Get to know your tree. See if the soil is moist enough. See if there are weeds growing up around the bottom that threaten to choke out the tree. So notice carefully what your child may need. Perhaps they need a little more time and space to run wild and you can look the other way. Perhaps they need a little more time when your phone is off or put away each day. Ask them how they do things, or ask them how they knew that fascinating piece of information. Research them! Make them feel like they are on a talk show and everyone cares about them. Appreciate the fruit. Approach their actions with the same wonder and curiosity. How do you open it, what is its texture. Watch them do things. Sometimes I marvel at how a child dresses himself. Pretend to look through binoculars so you can see them better.

Be a horticulturalist and be fascinated by your unidentified tree!
