        <h1> <p>Children feel feelings which are just a big as adults, yet lack the language to express them, which causes children to act out in various challenging ways. Aggression, silence, self-harm, risk-taking behaviour can be some of the signs that indicate a child is struggling. Children who are going through something difficult in their life, whether it is the birth of a new sibling, divorce, bereavement, or any trauma, often need support.

            Play Therapy is an evidence-based approach for  supporting children typically between the ages 3-11 who have emotional, psychological, and often behavioral issues. Play therapists conduct weekly sessions with children and work with their families and carers to understand the child's world and to improve overall well being.
